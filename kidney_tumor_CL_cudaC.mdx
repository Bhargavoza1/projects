Cutting-edge kidney tumor classification system! This project represents the culmination of my efforts, 
leveraging CUDA C++ and OpenCV to develop a sophisticated neural network for accurately classifying kidney tumors. 
Through extensive work, I have created a system that seamlessly integrates with a Golang server and is complemented by a React-powered frontend. 
Deployment on Azure AKS with GitHub Actions ensures streamlined deployment and management.

# Prerequisite Knowledge
1. C++ Programming
2. CUDA Programming
3. Neural Networks (CNN2d, maxpool2d, liner, relu, sigmoid, batch normalization, flatten layer)
4. OpenCV
5. Server-side Development (basic golang)
6. Frontend Development (basic react.js)
7. Containerization and Orchestration (docker and kubernetes)
8. Azure
9. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (Github actions)

## Features

- **CUDA C++ Neural Network:** At the core of this system is a robust neural network implemented entirely in CUDA C++, enabling efficient parallel processing and leveraging the power of GPUs for accelerated computations.

- **Golang Server Integration:** The neural network seamlessly integrates with a Golang server, facilitating smooth communication between the backend and frontend components.

- **React Frontend:** The frontend interface, powered by React, offers users an intuitive and interactive experience, allowing them to interact with the classification system effortlessly.

- **Deployment on Azure AKS:** Leveraging Azure AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) for deployment ensures scalability, reliability, and ease of management, providing a robust infrastructure for hosting the system.

- **GitHub Actions Deployment:** The deployment process is streamlined using GitHub Actions, enabling continuous integration and deployment with minimal manual intervention.
