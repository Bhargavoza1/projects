This practice project aims to explore predictive analytics using a diabetes dataset, employing two distinct algorithms for comparison – Logistic Regression and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Diabetes, a chronic metabolic disorder, poses a substantial global health challenge. Accurate and timely prediction of diabetes onset is crucial for preventive interventions and personalized patient care. In this project, 
we will harness the potential of machine learning to develop predictive models capable of identifying patterns within a diabetes dataset. The choice of Logistic Regression and MLP as the algorithms for comparison is motivated by their distinct methodologies, 
allowing us to evaluate their respective strengths and weaknesses in handling complex medical data.

Throughout this project, we will outline the preprocessing steps, feature engineering, and model training processes for both Logistic Regression and MLP. 
The comparative analysis will not only shed light on their predictive capabilities but also offer insights into the interpretability and generalizability of each model. 
The ultimate goal is to equip practitioners and enthusiasts with a deeper understanding of the nuances involved in selecting the appropriate machine learning algorithm for diabetes prediction tasks.

- **Interpretability**: Logistic Regression is generally more interpretable than complex models like MLP. The coefficients in Logistic Regression directly correspond to the impact of each feature on the output, 
providing a clear understanding of the model's decision process. MLP, being a neural network with multiple layers, can be more challenging to interpret due to its intricate architecture.\
Interpretability helps you see the impact of each piece of information on the model's output. For instance, if a model predicts loan approval, interpretability shows you how factors like income, credit score, and debt influence the decision.

- **Generalizability**: The generalizability of the models will be assessed based on their performance on unseen data. A model that can generalize well to new diabetes cases beyond the training dataset is preferable, 
as it indicates the ability to capture underlying patterns common to different instances of the problem. The comparison between Logistic Regression and MLP will help evaluate which model is more effective in terms of generalization for the given diabetes dataset.


# Diabetes Prediction

Let’s start writing practice project in jupyter notebook.
I ma using  [pima-indians-diabetes-database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command reads the requirements.txt file and installs all the specified dependencies.

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system, and the pip executable is added to your system's PATH.

```Python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import stats

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve, auc, precision_score, recall_score, roc_curve, roc_auc_score

import tensorflow as tf
```

Reading dataset from the local file.
```Python
diabetes_DS = pd.read_csv('data/diabetes.csv')
```

Now, Displays the first few rows of the dataset, statistical summary, shape (number of rows and columns), and the count of different classes in the **Outcome** column (0 - Non-Diabetic, 1 - Diabetic).

```Python
diabetes_DS.head()
```
<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bhargavoza1/projects/main/images/Diabetes-Prediction/dshead.png"  alt="biological neuron"  width={941} height={234} />

```Python
diabetes_DS.describe()
```
<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bhargavoza1/projects/main/images/Diabetes-Prediction/dsdescribe.png"  alt="biological neuron"  width={1000} height={348} />

```Python
diabetes_DS.shape
```
(768, 9)

```Python
diabetes_DS['Outcome'].value_counts()
```
Outcome \
0    500 \
1    268

0 - Non-Diabetic \
1 - Diabetic
