In recent years, transformer models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) and have found applications in various other domains such as computer vision and time series forecasting. Their ability to handle long-range dependencies and parallelize training has made them the go-to architecture for many state-of-the-art models.

Nowadays, transformers and their variants are everywhere. Let's deep dive into it and understand its code from scratch. In this article, we will explore the implementation of transformer models in PyTorch, leveraging the excellent tutorial and GitHub repository by Umar Jamil.

We will follow along with Umar Jamil's comprehensive [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISNdQcPhsts) tutorial and reference his [GitHub](https://github.com/hkproj/pytorch-transformer) repository to understand the intricate details of transformer models. This article is designed for those who already have a solid foundation in machine learning and PyTorch and are looking to expand their knowledge by delving into advanced models.

While utilizing these resources, I am also creating my own repository on GitHub to update it to the latest version and incorporate improvements, especially taking advantage of my RTX 4070 Ti GPU for efficient training and experimentation.
