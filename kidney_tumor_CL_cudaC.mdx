Cutting-edge kidney tumor classification system! This project represents the culmination of my efforts, 
leveraging CUDA C++ and OpenCV to develop a sophisticated neural network for accurately classifying kidney tumors. 
Through extensive work, I have created a system that seamlessly integrates with a Golang server and is complemented by a React-powered frontend. 
Deployment on Azure AKS with GitHub Actions ensures streamlined deployment and management.

## Features

- **CUDA C++ Neural Network:** At the core of this system is a robust neural network implemented entirely in CUDA C++, enabling efficient parallel processing and leveraging the power of GPUs for accelerated computations.

- **Golang Server Integration:** The neural network seamlessly integrates with a Golang server, facilitating smooth communication between the backend and frontend components.

- **React Frontend:** The frontend interface, powered by React, offers users an intuitive and interactive experience, allowing them to interact with the classification system effortlessly.

- **Deployment on Azure AKS:** Leveraging Azure AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) for deployment ensures scalability, reliability, and ease of management, providing a robust infrastructure for hosting the system.

- **GitHub Actions Deployment:** The deployment process is streamlined using GitHub Actions, enabling continuous integration and deployment with minimal manual intervention.

# Neural network architecture
<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bhargavoza1/projects/main/images/cuda_cnn/image_classification.png"  alt=""  width={512} height={895} />

The image shows a neural network architecture for image classification. The network takes an input image of size 225x225 and outputs a probability distribution over the possible classes. 
The network consists of several layers, including convolutional layers, ReLU activation layers, max-pooling layers, batch normalization layers, a flatten layer, linear layers, and a sigmoid activation layer.

The convolutional layers extract features from the input image. The ReLU activation layers introduce non-linearity into the network. The max pooling layers downsample the feature maps. 
The batch normalization layers normalize the activations. The flatten layer converts the feature maps into a single vector. The linear layers learn to classify the input image based on this vector. 
The sigmoid activation layer outputs a probability distribution over the possible classes.
